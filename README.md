# Dev-Utils-and-Templates

Repository focused on Salesforce development acceleration and good practices with Utils classes and templates commonly used in our projects repeatedly. Create to developers to use in their projects and iterate with more valuable pieces of code and make our repo richer in knowledge.

# changeable code in templates

All pieces os code that need to be replaced, in any code within this repo, are highlighted between double curly braces like {{}} and with a description that makes them easier to understand what you should put in that piece to get your template customized as you need to make them worth for your scenario.

# How to work with this repo

Each developer contributing to this repo have to create their own branch and can only modify their own branch. It makes easier to track who made the changes throughout the several commits we will have if we have to ask for help in some code that this dev has created or modified.

We have one main branch that is controlled by the admin o repo, the contributors developers can't change code or push any changes to main branch directly. When the contributors think that they have enough changes to merge with the main branch. they have to open and Pull Request to admin review the changes and see if the code has something to be fixed or can be merged.
